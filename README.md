# kcd-angular
This repository houses a Bower compatible version of http://kentcdodds.com/kcd-angular.

## Kent's Repo
The code found here was "cherry-pick" from Kent Dobbs' [**kcd-angular** repository](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-angular). The original repository contains examples and other items which make it not a great item to be used in a bower include. However, if you need to see how a specific utility is implemented then please see his examples pages.

## Installing

At the moment the bower package is set to private. You can still include this in your project as a dependency by using the following command:

````bower install SumTotalSystems/kcd-angular````

## Contributing

You will need to install _gulp_ in order to build the distributable files. At the moment there are no _bower_ dependencies.

````npm install````

````gulp````

This repository and its code were built for the needs of a specific project. Therefore, the items included may be a subset of those which Kent has demonstrated on his site or included in his repository. We encourage you to fork this repository and add any missing functionality. Pull requests are welcome!
